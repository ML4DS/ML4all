    "## 1. Data generation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things we need to learn is to generate random samples from a given distribution. Most things in life come muddled with random noise. A fundamental part of Detection and Estimation is finding out what the properties of this noise are in order to make better predictions. We assume that this noise can be modeled according to a specific probability distribution (i.e: nose generated by a Gaussian dastribution), which in turn allows us to make precise estimations of said distribution's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, random samples can be easily generated with the `numpy.random` package. Inside it we can find many usefull tools to sample from the most important probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have common number generator functions:\n",
    "* `rand()`: uniformily generates random samples.\n",
    "* `randn()`: returns samples from the “standard normal” distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more specific ones:\n",
    "* `exponential([scale, size])`: draw samples from an exponential distribution with a given scale parameter.\n",
    "* `normal([loc, scale, size])`:\tdraw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution with parameters: loc (mean) and scale (standard deviation).\n",
    "* `uniform([low, high, size])`: draw samples from a uniform distribution in the range low-high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples we will look at different random generation methods and we will visualize the results. For the time being, you can ignore the visualization code. Later on we will learn how these visualization tools work."
