    "### Practical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Though sometimes unavoidable, it is recommended not to use explicit matrix inversion whenever possible. For instance, if an operation like ${\\mathbf A}^{-1} {\\mathbf b}$ must be performed, it is preferable to code it using python `numpy.linalg.lstsq` function (see http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html), which provides the LS solution to the overdetermined system ${\\mathbf A} {\\mathbf w} = {\\mathbf b}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - [_Not needed_] Sometimes, the computation of $\\log|{\\mathbf A}|$ (where ${\\mathbf A}$ is a positive definite matrix) can overflow available precision, producing incorrect results. A numerically more stable alternative, providing the same result is $2\\sum_i \\log([{\\mathbf L}]_{ii})$, where $\\mathbf L$ is the Cholesky decomposition of $\\mathbf A$ (i.e., ${\\mathbf A} = {\\mathbf L}^\\top {\\mathbf L}$), and $[{\\mathbf L}]_{ii}$ is the $i$th element of the diagonal of ${\\mathbf L}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - [_Not needed_] Non-degenerate covariance matrices, such as the ones in this exercise, are always positive definite. It may happen, as a consequence of chained rounding errors, that a matrix which was mathematically expected to be positive definite, turns out not to be so. This implies its Cholesky decomposition will not be available. A quick way to palliate this problem is by adding a small number (such as $10^{-6}$) to the diagonal of such matrix."

The first measure (MSE) only compares the predictive mean with the actual value and always has a positive value (if zero was reached, it would mean a perfect prediction). It does not take into account predictive variance. The second measure (NLPD) takes into account both the deviation and the predictive variance (uncertainty) to measure the quality of the probabilistic prediction (a high error in a prediction that was already known to have high variance has a smaller penalty, but also, announcing a high variance when the prediction error is small won’t award such a good score)."
