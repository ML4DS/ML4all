    "### Practical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Though sometimes unavoidable, it is recommended not to use explicit matrix inversion whenever possible. For instance, if an operation like ${\\mathbf A}^{-1} {\\mathbf b}$ must be performed, it is preferable to code it using python $\\mbox{numpy.linalg.lstsq}$ function (see http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html), which provides the LS solution to the overdetermined system ${\\mathbf A} {\\mathbf w} = {\\mathbf b}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Sometimes, the computation of $\\log|{\\mathbf A}|$ (where ${\\mathbf A}$ is a positive definite matrix) can overflow available precision, producing incorrect results. A numerically more stable alternative, providing the same result is $2\\sum_i \\log([{\\mathbf L}]_{ii})$, where $\\mathbf L$ is the Cholesky decomposition of $\\mathbf A$ (i.e., ${\\mathbf A} = {\\mathbf L}^\\top {\\mathbf L}$), and $[{\\mathbf L}]_{ii}$ is the $i$th element of the diagonal of ${\\mathbf L}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Non-degenerate covariance matrices, such as the ones in this exercise, are always positive definite. It may happen, as a consequence of chained rounding errors, that a matrix which was mathematically expected to be positive definite, turns out not to be so. This implies its Cholesky decomposition will not be available. A quick way to palliate this problem is by adding a small number (such as $10^{-6}$) to the diagonal of such matrix."
